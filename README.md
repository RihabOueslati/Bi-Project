# Bi-Project
Time series Part 
This part can give us a clear view about the number of validation per day each year , and we can 
distinguish if there is any correlation between (t,t+1) and (t,t-1).
And with the 2 model ARMA and ARIMA we can predict the number of validation for the 6 first months for 2018.
